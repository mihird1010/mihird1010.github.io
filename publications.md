- **Prediction of systemic biomarkers from retinal photographs: development and validation of deep-learning algorithms**  <br> [[paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589750020302168) 
This work demonstrates the use of deep learning to retinal photographs to predict age, sex, blood pressure, and haematological parameters from retinal fundus images. 

- **Detection of pterygium** <br>[[demo]](https://pterygium.herokuapp.com)  [[code]](https://github.com/mihird1010/pterygium_detection)
We train CNNs to detect [pterygiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterygium_(conjunctiva)) from images and predict the necessasity of referral to specialists.
