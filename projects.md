- Prognosis of Diabetic Retinopathy by detection of microaneurysms [[thesis paper]](/files/papers/ma_detection_expt.pdf)
	+ Used Squeeze-Excitation modules in a fully connected network to detect onset of DR by detecting microaneurysms
	+ Outperforms the state-of-art on publicly available dataset  		


- [Analysis of Diabetic Retinopathy using deep learning](https://github.com/mihird1010/diabetic_retinopathy)
<!-- \hfill \DatestampYM{2018}{5} -  \DatestampYM{2018}{8}\\ -->
: Usage of transfer learning on pretrained state of the art image classifiers to detect severity from eye photographs. A YOLO type algorithm to detect location of  optic disk.

<!-- - [Modelling distribution of invasive animal species](https://github.com/mihird1010/spec_dist)
\hfill \DatestampYM{2018}{3} -  \DatestampYM{2018}{5}\\
: Usage of  iSDM, MaxEnt model and other predictive algorithms for invasive species modelling
 -->

- [Time Series Analysis of heart rate patterns](https://github.com/mihird1010/heart_lstm)
<!-- \hfill \DatestampYM{2018}{1} - \DatestampYM{2018}{4}\\ -->
: Implemented using sequence analysis by LSTM units on sensor readings obtained from Arduino and attached pulse sensor
- [Remote alerts system based on ICU patient vitals](https://github.com/mihird1010/icu)<!-- \hfill \DatestampYM{2017}{9}- \DatestampYM{2017}{12}\\ -->
	+ Assistance system for sending alerts as per real time severity
	+ Calculated with by moving average on multi-variate data of periodic reading of 24 vitals
